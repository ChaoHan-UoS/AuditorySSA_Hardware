# A robust model of Stimulus-Specific Adaptation validated on neuromorphic hardware
Here we provide the Matlab code to reproduce the results of the mean-field model in the paper "A robust model of Stimulus-Specific Adaptation validated on neuromorphic hardware".

## Description
`model_init.m` is the Matlab code for initializing the mean-field model network.\
`model_run.m` is the Matlab code for running the mean-field model network.\
`SimulationPlot.m` is the Matlab code for replotting the figures shown in the paper.
